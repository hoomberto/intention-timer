## Introduction
This is an interactive website that is meant to demonstrate an understanding of time-based functions, localStorage, HTML, CSS, data models, and adhering to HTML and CSS conventions. This site allows users to set an intention, create a timer based on given inputs provided by the user, and also allows users to store past activities.

## Features
- Users can select a category, set an intention, enter minutes, seconds value, and have a timer run corresponding to these inputs
- Users can log the activity that they have set
- Logged activities are saved to localStorage and are remembered upon leaving and revisiting 


Selecting a category icon will deselect any other icon
